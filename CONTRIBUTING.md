# Contributing to FanHero Generative AI Challenges

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to FanHero Generative AI Challenges! This document provides guidelines that will make the contribution process as smooth as possible.

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of this repository to your GitHub account. This is your own copy of the repository where you can make changes without affecting the original project.

2. **Clone the Repository**: After forking, clone the repository to your local machine so you have a workspace where you can make changes.

3. **Follow the Git Flow**: Make sure to adhere to the Git Flow branching model. This means you should create feature branches for new work, merge them into a develop branch, and eventually merge them into the main branch when they are ready for release.

4. **Python Version**: Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your local development machine. All code for the challenges must be compatible with Python 3.

5. **Manage Dependencies**: All dependencies used in the development process should be listed in a `requirements.txt` file. This ensures other contributors can set up their development environment easily.

6. **Create Pull Requests (PRs)**: After committing your changes to your feature branch, push the branch to your fork and then submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Commit Guidelines

- Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
- In the pull request description, explain the changes you have made and why you made them.
- Include any relevant issue numbers in your pull request description.
- Make sure that each commit in your pull request is atomic, addressing one concern per commit.

## Review Process

All contributions will be reviewed by the repository maintainers. During the review process, maintainers may request additional changes to your contribution. Keep your branch up to date with any changes in the main repository by regularly pulling from it.

## Documentation

Include a brief summary of your development process in a file named `DOCUMENTATION.md` in English. This document should outline the approach taken, tools used, and any other relevant information about your development process.

## Questions and Help

If you have any questions or need help with any step of the contribution process, please don't hesitate to open an issue, and someone from the team will get back to you.
